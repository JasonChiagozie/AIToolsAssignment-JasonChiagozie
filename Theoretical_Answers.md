üß† Part 1 ‚Äì Theoretical Understanding
Q1. Differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch
Feature	TensorFlow	PyTorch
Computation Style	Static graph (TensorFlow 1.x), dynamic graph (TensorFlow 2.x)	Fully dynamic (‚Äúdefine-by-run‚Äù)
Ease of Debugging	Harder in TF 1.x; improved in TF 2.x	Easier debugging with Pythonic syntax
Deployment	Great for production (TensorFlow Serving, TFLite)	Favored in research and experimentation
When to Choose	For scalable apps and mobile deployment	For flexibility, quick research, and prototyping
Q2. Two Use Cases for Jupyter Notebooks

Interactive Experimentation:
Data scientists use notebooks to test, visualize, and tweak code interactively.

Documentation & Sharing:
Each cell allows combining text, equations, and code ‚Äî perfect for tutorials and collaborative projects.

Q3. How spaCy Enhances NLP Tasks

spaCy provides pre-trained models for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and NER.

It‚Äôs faster and more accurate than basic Python string functions.

spaCy allows linguistic pipelines ‚Äî processing entire texts efficiently with minimal code.

Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow
Aspect	Scikit-learn	TensorFlow
Target Applications	Classical ML (e.g., regression, SVMs, decision trees)	Deep learning (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, transformers)
Ease of Use	Easier for beginners	Steeper learning curve
Community Support	Strong academic/research community	Larger industry and production community

üí° In summary:
Scikit-learn is best for quick, traditional machine learning models. TensorFlow shines in large-scale deep learning and deployment.
